Delivered a decision making model to suggest Indian government in curbing the adverse effects of Climate change using
MAUT (Multi Attribute Utility Theory), Correlation analysis, Monte Carlo stimulation and One way sensitivity analysis


On Monday, October 8th, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report that describes the risks and impacts of a 1.5°C temperature increase above pre-industrial levels within the next few decades:

The report describes consequences such as increasing droughts, food shortages, wildfires, and flooding by 2040 if no additional action is taken. The report asserts that mitigating these impacts would require a dramatic restructuring of the world economy. One potential approach is for governments to impose heavy carbon taxes.

Imagine that you are advising a government on if and how to address the issues raised in the report. You may choose any government that you like, but keep in mind that different governments will have different preferences. Furthermore, the impact of climate change is forecast to vary greatly by country. You will have to take this into account. Also, any regulatory approach you may choose will incur costs, and there is always the risk that regulations will be ineffective, make problems worse, or trigger unintended consequences. Apply the techniques you have learned in this class to develop a recommendation to the government you are advising regarding the implementation of policies to mitigate climate change.

In particular:

• Research the topic of climate change including benefits, costs, and risks. Cite all sources used.

• Develop a set of fundamental objectives and associated attributes

• Identify alternatives…there may be many. You can also create your own. Be creative. (Remember that doing nothing is also an alternative)

• Identify uncertain attributes and model them appropriately

• Develop a multi-attribute utility model to evaluate your alternatives

• Perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of your model

• Make a recommendation

This an open ended assignment. There is no right or wrong answer. Instead you will be evaluated by the quality of your analysis. There will most likely not be sufficient data to develop objective probability distributions. You may generate your own subjective probability distributions based on your interpretation of what you uncover during your research. Likewise you will need to develop your own utility functions to reflect your interpretation of the situation. Just ensure that you justify your assumptions.
